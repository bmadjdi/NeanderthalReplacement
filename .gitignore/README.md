# NeanderthalReplacement

Code for study published in Nature Communications, 2017: 
"A parsimonious neutral model suggests Neanderthal replacement was determined by migration and random species drift" (Kolodny & Feldman)

The main, non-spatial, model is the java code. The spatially explicit model, which focuses on a subset of the questions
dealt with in the main model, is implemented in a very simple matlab script.
